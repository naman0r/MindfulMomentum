# MindfulMomentul

## tech stack

- Frontend: React.js, Tailwind.css, PrimeReact, React-router-dom, vite
- Backend: Flask server with python, supabase as the official sql database.
- Authentication: Firebase (already implemented)

### to dos:

- figure out how to use JSON Web Tokens or cookies to actually secyre the communication between the frontend and backend.

### Why Am I doing this project, and what I hope to gain by the end:

- this would be a cool project for me to work on and deploy, and I can learn a lot through it.
- I actually want to understand a lot of the backend stuff, which I did not fully grasp during developing mindmapr.
- using flask to develop the backend is a lot more low level, and I feel that it is giving me a better picture of how things are working under the hood.
- I really want to learn TailwindCSS and use it in a project, and get really comfortable with it (learning by doing)
- I want to learn more complex topics like authorization using JWT and Cookies, and I want to learn the low level concepts behind these.
- Authentication with firebase and full deployment: I want to DEPLOY this project, and develop it in such a way that it is extremely secure and usable by the average user
- State management?? What it is, why I need it, and smart solution implemented (libraries to look at: Zustand, Redux)

- cool feature integration: I want to integrate a bunch of cool features such as Google Calendar API (if i can figure it out) to add tasks (habits) to user's google calendar automatically, or develop my own calendar like thing in this project.
- Push notifications, through email and in-app reminder system.
- Progress Charts & Stats â€“ Graphs showing habit completion rates (find out what library we used in NUtrition and try to use that or use something better)
- Gamification of UI: learn UI design and have fun with it

- AI- powered habit suggestions:
- adaptive streak system : allows flexibility. if a user misses a day, we can develop an algorithm that allows them to make up for it and regain their streak.
- social feature: /community and /challenges frontend routes after ddevelopment to make it fun, display user stats to the public.
- accountability partner feature
- Journalling function (CAN IMPLEMENT VOXYL IN THIS!!!!!!!)
- level up and XP
